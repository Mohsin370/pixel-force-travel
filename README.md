<h1>Placoo</h1>
<p>
This is a React project that is created with Vite and uses typeScript as the main language. 
TailwindCss is used as a major CSS library in the project.
The purpose of this project is to complete the challenge given by PixelForce.  
</p>

<h1>Project setup</h1>
<p>Setting up this project is very simple</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clone repository</li>
  <li>Switch to repository by typing cd pixel-force-travel</li>
  <li>Run command 'npm install' to install all the required packages</li>
  <li>Run command 'num run dev'</li>
  <li>The project should be running on port 5173 (http://localhost:5173/)</li>
</ol>

<p>For your ease, I have deployed the project on netflity and it is accessible on this <a href="https://main--mellow-mousse-fc236a.netlify.app/">Demo link</a> </p>

<h1>Notes for Reviewer</h1>
<p> I have tried to use the best naming convention and code properly formatted with prettier for your convenience.</p>
<p> The project is highly broken down into components for reusability purposes.</p>
<p> The project has responsive design as asked in the requirements.</p>

<h1>Project Specs and docs</h1>
<p>Figma designs can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/vtIAbUhIVhDqDjtpOCl74V/Front-End-Example?node-id=403%3A1811&mode=dev </p>
<p>Project description document reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10veP-H38kZDP3sBuDasvS1mPHb8dnUfaKDV6pqFxaIo/edit </p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>Home page - Use the Login button to move to the next screen</p>
<p>Login Page - Clicking on the login page will take you to the travel places page</p>
<p>Travel Page - Explore, Chat and profile are clickable to switch between tabs</p>

<h1>Assumptions and potential improvements</h1>
<p>The homepage images were not available in Figma so I have skipped the homepage images</p>
<p>The provided JSON apis had CORS Authorization issues so I have added the same JSON in a static array to replicate the same data. Moreover,  I have created a base API calls structure that can be used to simply call the APIs with Axios instead of static arrays.</p>
<p> Lazy load could have been applied to avoid delay in image loading </p>
<p>Card component could have been improved.</p>



<p>Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I am very positive that you will see through the effort that I have put into this project and I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you!</p>
